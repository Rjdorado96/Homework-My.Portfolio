# Homework-My.Portfolio
I worked on this first homework assignment by myself with no help from the TAs, instructor or my fellow peers. This was a major mistake. I now understand that in the world of web development, going solo will not take you too far. I have learned this firsthand with this homework assignment. I struggled learning CSS and how to apply it to my HTML, the homework is incomplete but I gave it my best shot. Moving forward I will use all the available resources I have at my disposal to complete homework number two. I will unfortunatly miss the deadline, however, I will revist this homework and complete it at a later date. Web development is out of my comfort zone but I am fasinated by it and do wish to get good at learning the different languages out there. This is my new found passion, and although it has been a challenging start, I know I will soon make a breakthrough if I stick with it and keep applying myself to the material.
