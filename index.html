        Hello my name is Ruben. I am currently embarking in a difficult path known as Web Devolopment/Coding. For the next 24 weeks I will be stressed beyond belief since I have no background in IT.
        I am putting myself through this because I know Web Development can be rewarding. By the end of these 24 weeks I am hoping to be able to build my own websites and applications. I want to use my skillset
        to help myself and others recreate the ideas we have inside of us. In the scarce moments when I am not plagued by stress or surrounded by code, I enjoy being active at the gym and outdoors.
